# Nacht des Schreckens

![demo of the map](demo.png)

This mod is meant to bring the features and spirit of classic Call of Duty Zombies maps into Doom 2 through a remake of their very first map. While this has been done before, I hope to bring this type of mod into a category of its own. Eventually, a standalone library will be released to allow anyone to make their own horde mode maps in GZDoom.

## Next Milestone

This mod is still early in development, so the map is very basic, the weapon roster is limited, and there are many placeholder textures. Currently, I am working towards a demo filling in these issues by creating a memorable starting area, porting more weapons from World at War, creating and pulling more assets, stabilizing the multiplayer experience, and adding and easter egg or two :)
